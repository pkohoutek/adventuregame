You enter the last room and you see where Scarlett's body was found outlined in tape on the floor. 
You have 2 suspects left. Narrow it down to the murderer to escape.
</STARTTEXT>
<ENDTEXT>
The case is solved and you managed to uncover the murderer in an impressive amount of time. This
should prevent any misconstrued headlines in the newspaper and now you have the evidence to prove
Louie is guilty when he is put on trail for the murder of his own mother, Scarlett Johansson. 
Congratulations!

You begin sifting through the bookshelf for any traces of evidence when you pull out Scarlett's diary.
In her most recent entry before her passing, she wrote:

December 13th, 1989
I know what is going to happen to me, and I know who will do it. My children do not visit anymore. 
They only want what I have. I am changing my will to go to Chris, his family is in dire need of financial aid.
My children are going to be furious when I tell them, but they should earn their own place. 
                                                        -Scarlett Johansson


This information is incredibly revealing. Scarlett claims to have willingly changed her inheritance to go to 
Chris, but there's no proof that this was her true motive or whether or not there had been any outside pressures
making her say this. Also, who is to say they Louie even knew that she had changed it? Or who is to say that he
did not know? Louie could have known and murdered out of anger, or Louie could have not known, and murdered in
hopes of inheriting a fortune.

Footnotes... what could it mean? You start to retrace your steps and remember there was a footnote on the financial
documents that contained Scarlett's will. You open up your files to read the document again and on the very last
page there is a footnote that only contains the letter 'L'. It is subtle, easy to miss, but it is right under the
passage where Scarlett declared her fortune will no longer be going to her sons.
Head to the final door to attempt your escape.
