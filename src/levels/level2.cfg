are getting messy. Now that you have a sneaking suspicion that Chris may be responsible, you need to
search for any clues that pertain to him.

You pick up the phone and give the voicemails a listen.
'This is the hospital calling. It's 10:00pm. Hewey has been in a serious car accident on the main highway, 
and we are taking him into surgery right now. Please contact us at the hospital as soon as possible'

Hewey left at 10:00pm! The murder was not until at least midnight according to our autopsy report. This 
eliminates Hewey as a suspect.
