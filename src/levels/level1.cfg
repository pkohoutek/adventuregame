Although you have solved many murder cases in the past, you have stumbled upon a rather tricky one. 
It's high-profile: the woman deceased was of great wealth, and a disturbing note was left at the crime 
scene. It may appear to be a suicide at first glance, but it is far too suspicious. Scarlett Johansson 
was envied for her wealth and fame, and she had inherited a rather fortunate business from her father 
before he passed. Her three children, and many others, all seemed too eager for a piece of her fortune 
and notorety. Who killed Scarlett? 

You must leave no stone unturned as you try to solve this crime and figure out what really happened to Scarlett.

We know that Huey, Dewey and Louie are suspects. But now we have added Chris Evans to the roster, and Huey and Dewey
and Louie could have either known or not known that she was giving him her fortune. Things are getting messy. 

Now that you have a sneaking suspicion that Chris may be responsible, you need to search for any clues that pertain to him.

Scarlett has 3 children with her husband Brad Pitt, who passed away only a year ago in a horrible plane accident. 
He was on a business trip and extreme weather conditions overthrew the plane's course as it crashed into a forested area
and burned. Her children, Huey, Dewey and Louis are all married and living in the city, but they would visit Scarlett in
the country from time to time for her lavish parties and special occasions or holidays. The night of Scarlett's death, 
she had thrown an extravagant party which was the perfect occasion for her children to be visiting. 

Wait 

'Is this a party invitation? What's wrong with it?'

You open a drawer of Scarlett's desk and find some financial documents... It looks right before Scarlett died, she changed her
 will so her entire fortune would go to someone she had just met 2 weeks prior - her new romantic partner that she just began 
 seeing. He was probably at the party too, but the only way to find out is to translate the cipher that shows his name on this paper.
